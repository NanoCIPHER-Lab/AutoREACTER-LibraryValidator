"""
Module for detecting reactions and handling non-reactant monomers.

This module provides functionality to analyze a set of input monomers, detect
potential chemical reactions based on functional groups, and identify monomers
that do not participate in any detected reactions. It also includes an interactive
workflow to allow users to decide whether to retain non-reactant molecules in
the simulation.
